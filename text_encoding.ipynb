Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the Slytherins, so they didn't have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at least, they didn't until they spotted a notice pinned up in the Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting on Thursday -- and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.\",\n",
       " '\"Typical,\" said Harry darkly. \"Just what I always wanted. To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.\"',\n",
       " 'He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else. \"You don\\'t know that you\\'ll make a fool of yourself,\" said Ron reasonably. \"Anyway, I know Malfoy\\'s always going on about how good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that\\'s all talk.\"',\n",
       " \"Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn't the only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen about the time he'd almost hit a hang glider on Charlie's old broom. Everyone from wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster of West Ham soccer team, trying to make the players move.\",\n",
       " \"Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.\",\n",
       " \"Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out of a book -- not that she hadn't tried. At breakfast on Thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tips she'd gotten out of a library book called @Quidditch @Through @the @Ages. Neville was hanging on to her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.\",\n",
       " \"Harry hadn't had a single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.\",\n",
       " 'A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s a Remembrall!\" he explained. \"Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there\\'s something you\\'ve forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh …\" His face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, \"… you\\'ve forgotten something …\"',\n",
       " \"Neville was trying to remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Remembrall out of his hand.\",\n",

       " '\"Malfoy\\'s got my Remembrall, Professor.\"',\n",
       " 'Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the table.',\n",

       " 'At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffindors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance.',\n",
       " 'The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.',\n",
       " 'Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk.',\n",
       " '\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\" she barked. \"Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.\"',\n",
       " 'Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck out at odd angles.',\n",
       " '\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\" called Madam Hooch at the front, \"and say ‘Up!\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"UP!\" everyone shouted.',\n",
       " \"Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on the ground.\",\n",
       " \"Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong for years.\",\n",
       " '\"Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground, hard,\" said Madam Hooch. \"Keep your brooms steady, rise a few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. On my whistle -- three -- two —\"',\n",
       " \"But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.\",\n",
       " '\"Come back, boy!\" she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and --',\n",
       " 'WHAM -- a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight.',\n",
       " 'Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as his. \"Broken wrist,\" Harry heard her mutter. \"Come on, boy -- it\\'s all right, up you get.\"',\n",
       " 'She turned to the rest of the class. \"None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you\\'ll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.\\' Come on, dear.\"',\n",
       " 'Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.',\n",
       " 'No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into laughter.',\n",
       " '\"Did you see his face, the great lump?\"',\n",
       " 'The other Slytherins joined in.',\n",
       " '\"Shut up, Malfoy,\" snapped Parvati Patil.',\n",
       " '\"Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?\" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. \"Never thought @you\\'d like fat little crybabies, Parvati.\"',\n",
       " '\"Look!\" said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out of the grass. \"It\\'s that stupid thing Longbottom\\'s gran sent him.\"',\n",
       " 'The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.',\n",
       " '\"Give that here, Malfoy,\" said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking to watch.',\n",
       " 'Malfoy smiled nastily. \"I think I\\'ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree?\"',\n",
       " '\"Give it @here!\" Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn\\'t been lying, he @could fly well. Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called, \"Come and get it, Potter!\"',\n",
       " 'Harry grabbed his broom.',\n",
       " '@\"No!\" shouted Hermione Granger. \"Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you\\'ll get us all into trouble.\"',\n",
       " \"Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him -- and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught -- this was easy, this was @wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and an admiring whoop from Ron.\",\n",
       " 'He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.',\n",
       " 'Malfoy looked stunned. \"Give it here,\" Harry called, \"or I\\'ll knock you off that broom!\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, yeah?\" said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried.',\n",
       " 'Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Malfoy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time; Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few people below were clapping.',\n",
       " '\"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,\" Harry called.',\n",
       " 'The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.',\n",
       " '\"Catch it if you can, then!\" he shouted, and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.',\n",
       " 'Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down -- next second he was gathering speed in a steep dive, racing the ball -- wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the screams of people watching -- he stretched out his hand -- a foot from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall clutched safely in his fist.',\n",
       " '\"HARRY POTTER!\"',\n",
       " \"His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling.\",\n",
       " '@\"Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts —\" Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, \"— how @dare you -- might have broken your neck —\"',\n",

       " '\"But Malfoy —\" \"That\\'s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.\"',\n",
       " \"Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall's wake as she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep?\",\n",
       " \"Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say a word to him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.\",\n",
       " 'Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened the door and poked her head inside.',\n",
       " '\"Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a moment?\"',\n",
       " \"Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was going to use on him? But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who came out of Flitwick's class looking confused.\",\n",
       " '\"Follow me, you two,\" said Professor McGonagall, and they marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry.',\n",
       " '\"In here.\"',\n",
       " 'Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the blackboard.',\n",
       " '\"Out, Peeves!\" she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boys.',\n",
       " '\"Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood -- I\\'ve found you a Seeker.\"',\n",

       " '\"Absolutely,\" said Professor McGonagall crisply. \"The boy\\'s a natural. I\\'ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on a broomstick, Potter?\"',\n",
       " \"Harry nodded silently. He didn't have a clue what was going on, but he didn't seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling started coming back to his legs.\",\n",
       " '\"He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\" Professor McGonagall told Wood. \"Didn\\'t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn\\'t have done it.\"',\n",

       " '\"I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can\\'t bend the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn\\'t look Severus Snape in the face for weeks. ….\"',\n",
       " 'Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.',\n",

Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as \"If he tries to curse you, you\\'d better dodge it, because I can\\'t remember how to block them.\" There was a very good chance they were going to get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy\\'s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness -- this was his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn\\'t miss it.',\n",

       " 'The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle.',\n",
       " '\"RUN!\" Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room.',\n",
       " '\"I think we\\'ve lost him,\" Harry panted, leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.',\n",

       " '\"Malfoy tricked you,\" Hermione said to Harry. \"You realize that, don\\'t you? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.\"',\n",

       " '\"Should tell Filch, I should,\" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. \"It\\'s for your own good, you know.\"',\n",
       " '\"Get out of the way,\" snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves -- this was a big mistake.',\n",
       " '\"STUDENTS OUT OF BED!\" Peeves bellowed, \"STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR!\"',\n",

       " '\"Don\\'t mess with me, Peeves, now @where @did @they @go?\" \"Shan\\'t say nothing if you don\\'t say please,\" said Peeves in his annoying singsong voice. \"All right -- @please.\"',\n",
       " '\"NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn\\'t say nothing if you didn\\'t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!\" And they heard the sound of Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.',\n",
       " '\"He thinks this door is locked,\" Harry whispered. \"I think we\\'ll be okay -- get @off, Neville!\" For Neville had been tugging on the sleeve of Harry\\'s bathrobe for the last minute. @\"What?\"',\n",

       " \"It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry knew that the only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.\",\n",

Filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat Lady on the seventh floor.\",\n",
